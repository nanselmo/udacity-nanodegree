    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 0 |  B  |  | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n",
    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most $50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",

    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "\n",

    "*  Real world application: The San Francisco Police Department used Random Forest modeling to predict crime based on a varity of features including the prior number of crimes, the location, day of year and temperature.\n",
    "*  Strength: Generally well performing, easy to tune, provides good indicator of feature importance\n",
    "*  Weakness: Slow\n",
    "*  Why this model? This is an ensemble method that uses a bunch of decsision tress to classify the donor as >50k or not. This combination will lead to a more accurate model. With this dataset, a lot of the features are correlated and Random Forests does a good job taking correlation into account.\n",

    "\n",
    "2.   Gradient Tree Boosting (Ensemble)\n",
    "\n",

    "*  Real world application: Face detection is arguably more complicated than more basic image classification (which SVMS can take care of). For this reason, a boosting method is good for such a detail-heavy application like mapping faces to individuals.\n",
    "*  Strength: Good for categorical features, reinforcement learning leads to high accuracy\n",
    "*  Weakness: Run sequentially, takes a while, sensitive to overfitting, doesn't work well with correlated predictors\n",
    "*  Why this model? This model learns from the mistakes of each preceeding model by punishing misclassified points as it builds new trees - which means it's very accurate. This dataset also has a lot of catergorical features which plays into the strength of boosting. Finally, Gradient Tree Boosting is generally very successful in Kaggle competitions, so I imagine it will perform well here.\n",

    "*  Strength: Handle high dimensional data well, high accuracy\n",
    "*  Weakness: Memory intenstive, hard to interpret, difficult to tune\n",
    "*  Why this model? We are only trying to classify our data into two classes and we have 103 features (after one-hot encoding) so a model like this that deals well with high-dimensional data is worth trying. \n",

When 100% of the training data is used, this model, with an F-score of 0.74 slightly bests both the random forest classifier and handedly beats the support vector classifier.

Relative to the random forest classifier, this training time was thirteen times longer but the prediction time was about two times shorter. Support vector classifiers are notoriously slow.

    "In general, boosting models are successful because they build a successive series of models that \"learn\" from eachother. Gradient tree boosting, uses the concept of boosting to iterate on decision trees. \n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees  create splits by asking questions about certain features. For example, if you wanted to classify Disney characters as \"princess\" or \"not princess\" the first split might be on gender - so the root would be \"Is this character a female?\". One branch would represent all the females, the other would represent all the males. Additional branches can get created off of each branch as the tree \"grows\" downward. When deciding which features to split and what criteria to ask about, the \"best\" tree is one that accurately classifies the information (princess or non princess) but is also as small as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we have a powerful computer, not only are we able to explore all possible splits for our cenus data, but we can also learn from each tree to find the best possible tree. With the first decision tree, potential donors and non donors are filtered by splitting the entire dataset across a certain parameter (age, education level, occupational status). Branches continue to get added until all of the people in the dataset are classified. However, on the first go-around, some people will be incorrectly classified (when compared to their original labels), so the model also accounts for those errors with a new set of random data to build a new, better tree. Each decision tree \"learns\" from the prior one and at the end, all of the models are added together to create the best model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the best decision tree model is created, predictions can be made by  by running that data through each question in the decision tree to land at a classification. Essentially the decision tree is a flow-chart of questions and once it is trained, that flow-chart can predict new datapoints."

    "\n",
    "So I only predicted two of the top five most important features. Capital gain was the most important feature and I should have drawn a connection to capital-loss as well, ultimately if folks are investing, they have enough to live comfortably. Marital status is a suprising one, and I'm interested in learning more. Age is another one that I overlooked. Certainly those who are under 25 or over 55 will have a different capacity to make $50,000 than those who are more in their prime income-earning years. Finally, education_num was a feature that I thought would play into the classification. It'd be interesting to see how these feature importances would change for a regression model instead of a classification model. "

    "### Feature Selection\n",
    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
